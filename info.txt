This file is where I will track my learning progress
12/05/18: learned how to work with dates and files, I also did some string formatting
12/07/18: I am learning about generators in python. I am not quite grasping the concept yet.
I will keep on reading about it and see if I can fully understand it.
I will keep reading over the weekend, coding to be resumed on Monday.
12/10/18: I learned some more about generators, I understand a little bit better.
I proceed to work with functions.
12/11/18: I learned some more about functions. I learned about Lambda functions. I made a little
program that brings it all together. I create a file, open it and add data on it all that using functions.
12/12/18: The same program I made yesterday with the functions, I added classes in it.
