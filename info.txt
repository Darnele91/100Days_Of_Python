This file is where I will track my learning progress
12/05/18: learned how to work with dates and files, I also did some string formatting
12/07/18: I am learning about generators in python. I am not quite grasping the concept yet.
I will keep on reading about it and see if I can fully understand it.
I will keep reading over the weekend, coding to be resumed on Monday.
12/10/18: I learned some more about generators, I understand a little bit better.
I proceed to work with functions.
12/11/18: I learned some more about functions. I learned about Lambda functions. I made a little
program that brings it all together. I create a file, open it and add data on it all that using functions.
12/12/18: The same program I made yesterday with the functions, I added classes in it.
12/13/18: I fixed a minor problem on my git configuration. I changed the email address from my
personal email to my work email. I was not able to commit from my local repo, now I can!  
12/14/18: I started the Data Science part of Python. I got an overview of the Python Data Science ecosystem.
I downloaded Anaconda, get acquainted with Jupyter notebook. I also learned about Markdown syntax to create report
in Jupyter Notebook. Tomorrow I will be working on my TJBot(I haven't found a name for him yet) therefore I won't 
be doing any Data Science study. Study to be resumed on Monday.
12/17/18: I worked with numpy array 1D. I did subsetting, slicing and logical indexing. Tomorrow I continue with 2D.
12/18/18: I worked in numpy array 2D. I did subsetting, slicing and logical indexing.
Tomorrow I will continue with functions in numpy. 
12/19/18: I did not start working with functions in numpy as intended. I did some more exercises on NumPy Arrays 
manipulation. Tomorrow I start with Functions in NumPy.
